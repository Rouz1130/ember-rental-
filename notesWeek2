CUTSOM HELPERS
-Helpers give us a tool to add custom display functionality to our templates.
-They are most often used to take input (often values from models or components)
and return display output (often formatted data or other user interface).
-ember g helper "name of file"
-Ember.String.htmlSafe(); is a method that allows Ember to render our line of HTML. Ember escapes HTML by default to protect against cross-site scripting vulnerabilities. Without calling
 Ember.String.htmlSafe(); the line<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-fire"></span> will appear literally on the page, instead of rendering our nice glyphicon. )

 -Once you create a helper : Call the helper in our index Template(index.hbs)
